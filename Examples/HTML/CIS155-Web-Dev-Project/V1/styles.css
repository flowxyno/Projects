   M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-classes and a pseudo-element selector (CSS, specify 2 times,
   show one pseudo-class and one pseudo-element, see 2-18 Using Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements) : 
   I did not include an example of using Pseudo-Elements as my page at this point has a small
   amount of content and I could not identify a place for it that made sense.

   Colors that are marked in any kind of rgb or hsl were generated from the site:
     https://rgbcolorcode.com/color/660000
*/

/* Structural Styles */
html {
    background-color: black; 
}
/* M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS (CSS, see 2-5 Working with Color in CSS) : there are many examples
   of applying colors using CSS in this document.
*/
/* M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS (CSS, see 2-6 
   Employing Progressive Enhancement) : by putting in both an rgb value and and hsl value we insure
   that older browsers can still display the color as intended as hsl was introduced in CSS3
*/
header {
    background-color: rgb(102, 0, 0);
    color: rgb(227, 226, 202);
    color: hsl(58, 31%, 84%);
}
/* M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified
   2 times, once where precedence is applied and once where inheritance is applied : This is an
   example of style inheritance everything that appears in the HTML body will have a set background
   color and it's text will be black
*/
body {
    background-color: rgb(227, 226, 202);
    background-color: hsl(58, 31%, 84%);
    color: black;
    margin: 10px;
}
/* M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different
   types of contextual selectors as shown in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook) : 
   This is an example of the element selector, it selects the footer element and changes the background 
   and text color from what the CSS for the body and html elements have listed
*/   
footer {
    background-color: rgb(207, 109, 52);
    color: rgb(227, 226, 202);
    color: hsl(58, 31%, 84%);
}
/* M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id
   (CSS, specify 1 time, see 2-9b Attribute selectors) : gives the font style Italic to any hypertext 
   element that contains the href attribute
*/
a[href] {
    font-style: italic;
}

/* Navigation Styles */
/* M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements 
   (CSS, these are styles that impact page elements rather than impacting text on the page) :
   Forces the Nav section to display as a table instead of the default, which on chrome was an unordered list
*/
nav {
    display: table;
    width: 100%;
}
nav > ul {
    display: table-row;
}
nav > ul > li {
    display: table-cell;
    border-width: 2px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    text-align: center;
}

    padding-top: 8px;
    padding-bottom: 8px;
}
nav a:link, nav:visited {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: none;
}
/* M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-classes and a pseudo-element selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show 
   one pseudo-class and one pseudo-element, see 2-18 Using Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements) : 
   Controls the text color and background color of the menu items when the mouse hovers over them
*/
nav a:hover, nav a:active {
    color: rgb(227, 226, 202);
    color: hsl(58, 31%, 84%);
    background-color: rgb(102, 0, 0);
}


/* sec styles */
/* M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified
   2 times, once where precedence is applied and once where inheritance is applied : This is an
   example of style precedence as the articles are usually located in the HTML body this supercedes 
   the body back ground color with tan 
*/
article {
    background-color: tan;
}
/* M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different 
   types of contextual selectors as shown in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook) :
   This is an example of the parent > child selector where article is the parent and h1 is the child
   and the underline will be applied to all h1 elements with in any article
*/
article > h1 {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
/* M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements (CSS, these are styles 
   that impact text that is rendered on the page) : This shows the use of CSS to change the type of 
   font, size and alignment on this webpage
/* M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, 
   show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b Attribute selectors) : This shows the use of an id
   selector in where font family, size, style and alignment are changed from the page default

/* M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, 
   show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b Attribute selectors) : This shows the use of a class
   selector in font family, size, and style are changed from the page default
