            M4LO7 Demonstrate the use of image maps, including determining x and y values (HTML) - I could not find a good spot to include an image map. To demonstrate understanding an image map is a set of commands that allow you to break up an image such as
            a family photo to where you could click on say each face and it would take you to a link that is attached to that spot. The linkable space is in a say a circular link would be denoted to the HTML in the x,y values of the center of the space along with 
            the radius.

            <p>In this site you will find the following:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Some of my favorite books to read and why.</li>
                  <li>A few books that I intend on reading, if I ever have the time again.</li>
                  <li>.... and a little information about me sprinkled all over</li>
               </ol>
            <p>Reading became very important to me when I was young and has remained a favorite pass
              time as I got older. Regardless if it was being buried in snow in Michigan where I grew up or 
              being deployed to Iraq, a book has quite honestly helped me keep my sanity in some tough
              environments.
            </p>
            <P>You will find that I greatly enjoy the Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Adventure Genres
              with a little Horror/Supernatural thrown in. I hope that you find a book that is or was
              an old friend and some more that are new and exciting. 
            </P>
            <p>To wet your appetite one of my favorite authors did a video trailer for his 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxoUzJyLCT0">Expeditionary Force</a> series of books 
              this is a must read for sci-fi connoisseurs out there.
